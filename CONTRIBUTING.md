# Contributing Guidelines

Feel free to contribute to this project directly via a pull request. 


## Adding new resources

- When adding a new resource, **only add it if you can recommend it and have personally benefitted from it**.
- An included resource should provide comprehensive, self-sufficient knowledge of the sub-topic it is in. Example - Don't add a video on CSS Grid as a resource in the web development sub-topic. On the other hand, a YouTube playlist on building websites will work. The more a resource covers the sub-topic, the better.
- Adding new resources to promote them is strictly prohibited. Doing so, your Pull Request will be labelled `self-promotion` and any more contribution from you will not be considered.
- Please follow correct format when adding the resource. See the format below.


## Resource listing markdown format

```md
### {Full name of resource}

{Short description to demonstrate why you are recommending this resource}

Website - {URL to the resource}

[![{image alt}]({Image URL of the resource, hosted on GitHub CDN})]({URL to the resource})
```

To host images on GitHub, see the [hosting images section](#host).


## Ordering of topics and resources

In `README.md`, topics should be ordered in alphabetical order.

In a topic file such as [finance.md](https://github.com/aviaryan/learn-for-free/blob/master/finance.md), sub-topics should be ordered in alphabetical order.

The resources in each of the sub-topics should be ordered in the order they were added.
