## Motivation behind this project

Lots of people want to learn web design, programming, app development, digital marketing etc but they don't have the resources to do so. This problem is more so common in third-world countries like India where people are relatively poor. With this project, we hope to create a comprehensive resource that can help anyone who wants to learn something but can't do so because of financial issues.
